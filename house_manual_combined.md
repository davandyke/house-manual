Television and Music:

YouTube TV is available on the main TV menu for live television including local
channels. The television is on an extension swivel wall mount, so if desired you can
extend out from the wall and angle towards your viewing area. Please replace its
position prior to check out.

Our stereo receiver can accept Bluetooth or Apple Airplay. To use these, use the “Net”
button on the Onkyo remote.

Generator:

In the event of a power outage we have a gas generator that can be connected to the
house and can power everything except for the air conditioner. Please contact me for
instructions in the event of a power outage. You can view outage information at the
Great Lakes Energy ‘Storm Central’ site.

There is a basic first aid kit in a drawer in the main bathroom.

Wood Stove/Fire Ring:

Firewood is available for both the wood stove and fire ring next to the blue shed. An axe
is available in the entry closet to split pieces smaller for starting the fire. We usually
have some fire starter available in the entry closet.

For cooler months there is a wood burning stove in the living room. When starting the
stove pull the top knob out (this bypasses the secondary burn chamber) and push the
bottom know all the way in (this maximizes airflow). Start with very small kindling and
increase wood size gradually. When the fire is going well, push the top knob back in,

and then use the bottom knob to adjust the burn rate. Gradually pulling it out will slow

the fire down.

There is a fire ring in the yard between the house and the road. Outdoor fires are only
permitted when there are not burning restrictions in place for Oceana County. If the
Michigan DNR Burn Permit page states “Burning Permits Issued Yes” then it is ok to

have a fire in the ring:
https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/BurnPermits/Search.aspx?OCEANA.

Please also use common sense. Even if the site says burning permitted, please do not
have an outdoor fire on a dry windy day. Firefighting capabilities in our rural area are

limited.

Please turn on the bathroom fan for ventilation if you shower in the main bathroom. The

bathroom fan in the master bathroom runs continuously as specified by code to

the can is nearly full, on Wednesday please bring the trash can to side of the road next
to the mailbox in the morning (or the night before) and bring it back at the end of the
day. There is no recycling service in our area.

Grills:
We have a Weber gas grill, charcoal grill, and smoker.

If you use a grill, the expectation is to clean it. There is grill cleaning spray and scrub
pads in the entry closet to use after the grates have cooled. There are also grill mitts, rib
racks, and a digital meat thermometer in the entry closet. Since the smoker is low heat,
the grates will require hand washing after use and the water basin will need to be

sprayed out with the garden hose.
There is a spare propane tank between the two charcoal grills.

The Country Dairy store in New Era has a selection of local brats/sausage (including
asparagus brats) and ground beef as well as a few other cuts.

Septic and Well:

We have both a well and a septic system. Do not flush wipes etc. down the toilet, or
food down the sink drain, as the septic will not process it. This is true even if advertised
as ‘flushable.’ The small faucet near the sink is from a reverse osmosis water filter

which removes all ions causing the "hard water" taste.

Supplies:

There are cleaning supplies, including upholstery and carpet cleaner, underneath the
master bath sink if you spill. Plunger is under main and master bath sinks. Broom and
mop are in the entry closet. Toilet paper is under master and main bath sinks. Paper
towels, napkins, and additional toilet paper rolls are in kitchen pantry closet or in the

master bedroom closet. Please contact us if any supplies are running low.

House Manual

Lake Michigan Beachfront Cottage

8975 S Indian Hills Rd
Montague, MI 49437

Welcome to our home! We purchased this cottage in 2017 in order to spend more time
on Lake Michigan and to share time with family and friends, creating memories for our
niece and nephews. We enjoy all seasons from swimming and sun in the summer,
changing of leaves and warm breezes off the lake in the fall, checking out lake ice
formations and watching sunsets next to a cozy fire in the winter, to new flowers and
roadside asparagus stands in the spring. We are now happy to share our home with
you! Don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions using either the Airbnb app
(preferred) or cell phone numbers below.
