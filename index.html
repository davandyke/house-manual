<p>Welcome to my home! I purchased this cottage in 2017 to spend more time on Lake Michigan and to create memories with family and friends. I enjoy all seasons here: swimming and sun in the summer, changing leaves and warm breezes in the fall, watching ice formations and sunsets by the fire in winter, and blooming flowers and roadside asparagus in the spring. I’m now happy to share this space with you.</p>
